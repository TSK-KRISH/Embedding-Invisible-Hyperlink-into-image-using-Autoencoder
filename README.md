This project focuses on comparing U-Net and Autoencoder models performance in Image steganography domain which embeds invisible hyperlinks into an image.
To evaluate the performance of these two models, we generated different datasets of images consisting of blurred, tilted, brightness added and noise distortions. All these image datasets are used to train the models and the final output is compared by RMSE, SSIM and PSNR metrics.

Based on our comparision, Autoencoder slightly outperforms U-Net in terms of preserving image quality during the process of encoding.
